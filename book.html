                    <p>
                    Tensor Networks (TNs) graphical notations, originally developed in physics, provide an elegant and intuitive way to represent linear operations on tensors. 
                    In modern deep learning, which heavily relies on tensor operations, this notation is particularly useful for clearly visualizing and understanding these 
                    processes. Tensor operations can be complex and easy to misinterpret, but graphical notation simplifies the process, allowing for quick understanding of 
                    the high-dimensional tensors. Whether you are a researcher, student, or professional, this book will equip you with the knowledge and tools 
                    to effectively work with high-dimensional tensors.
